## Notices

::: info Welcome

Welcome to all new visitors!

### Downloads and Releases

We are constantly working on the editor and maintain both rolling and regular releases.
You can find out more about the differences and download Pulsar on our [downloads page](https://pulsar-edit.dev/download.html)
and following the instructions.

### App Updates

Currently Pulsar does not support automatic app updates. There are, however, automated notifications of new versions,
which include links and instructions so you can easily get the new versions when they come out. (These notifications can be disabled if you wish.)
Beyond that, new versions can be obtained via the Download links here on our website, or from our CI (continuous integration) pages as explained on our Download page.

### Blog

For updates on the _goings-on_ around here, please do check out our [blog](https://pulsar-edit.dev/blog/)!

### Packages

One of our first and biggest tasks was to replace the closed source Atom.io
package repository with our own so that users would still be able to download
from the huge package ecosystem.

Searching and downloading from the package [package repository](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/) is now fully supported,
as is publishing/updating/deleting packages. If you experience any issues, please feel free to report this to the Pulsar Team.

### Support and Community

If you have any problems when using Pulsar, then please do let us know in one of our [community areas](https://pulsar-edit.dev/community.html)
or as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug-report.yml).
