# Packages Documentation

This aims to be a collection of information about the packages published for the Pulsar Editor.

Secondly, and currently, anything in [Core Packages](/docs/packages/core/) is an archive of every Wiki that was published from the upstream Atom Organization.

This means some of this information may be old, or no longer relevant. If it is, it has been marked as so at the top of the file under a warning.

None-the-less the information can still be helpful, and may prove to be valuable. Which is why it has been archived here.

Lastly, we're keeping a record of [community packages](/docs/packages/community-packages) as well. This is meant to be a record of these. This section should be updated as we get more community contributions of these. The process for adding this will be added at a later date.
