Pulsar will always be free and fully open to the community but we do have some
running costs associated with hosting the package repository along with other
expenses.

If you wish to contribute to the running costs of the project we have an
[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/pulsar-edit) where you can safely
donate and view how the money is being used.

We are currently talking about other donation platforms that we might support so
watch this space!
